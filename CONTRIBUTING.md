## Adding a Use Case

1. Create a markdown in the `/usecases` folder with the name of your usecase.
2. Add your usecase in detail. Here are a few suggested points to cover: 
   - **Pain Point** — What problem does this solve?
   - **What It Does** — Brief explanation of the use case
   - **Prompts** — The actual prompts/config you'd give OpenClaw
   - **Skills Needed** — Which OpenClaw skills are required
   - **Related Links** — Relevant docs, APIs, tools
3. Add a row to the relevant category table in the main [README.md](README.md)
4. Open a PR

## Guidelines

- One use case per markdown
- Keep descriptions concise but enough for someone to replicate
- If your use case doesn't fit an existing category, suggest a new one in your PR
- Duplicates are fine if the approach is meaningfully different
- Don't use AI to come up with new use cases. Only suggest use cases you have actually tested and verified.
- **No crypto-related use cases** — these will not be accepted.
