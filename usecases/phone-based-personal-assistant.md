# Phone-Based Personal Assistant

## Pain Point

You want to access your AI agent from any phone without needing a smartphone app or internet browser. You need hands-free voice assistance while driving, walking, or when your hands are occupied.

## What It Does

ClawdTalk enables OpenClaw to receive and make phone calls, turning any phone into a gateway to your AI assistant. You can:
- Call a phone number to speak with your AI agent via voice
- Get calendar reminders, Jira updates, and web search results via voice
- Integrate with Telnyx for reliable phone connectivity

SMS support is coming soon.

## Prompts

```
You are available via phone. When I call, greet me and ask how I can help.

For calendar queries: "What's on my calendar today?"
For Jira updates: "Show me my open tickets"
For web search: "Search for latest news on AI agents"
```
